#How to use WeatherWear

Before you start:
Make sure you have internet! Without it, you can’t get the weather.
Do you have items in your closet? Take a picture or choose from gallery to provide options for WeatherWear to construct your outfit from. Tell us what category they belong in, what seasons you want to wear them in, and how long you want to go in between wearing them.

#Preferences:
The most important thing here is current location vs. set location. If you choose current location, WeatherWear will suggest outfits based on the weather of your current location. Otherwise, you can set a location that WeatherWear will use to create outfits based on weather of that location, which you indicate by entering a 5 digit zipcode.
You can also change temperature display - i.e. Fahrenheit or celsius.

#Creating an outfit:
1. Click NEW in Today’s outfit
2. WeatherWear will bring up a new outfit screen, and you can toggle through possible weather appropriate choices
3. Click set current outfit, and you’ve created a new outfit!

#Things to note:
You  might encounter not being able to see an item of clothing, or not have any items of clothing in a certain category when constructing a new outfit. This is normal! Why?
1. If you set your clothing category to be in seasons that don’t match the current one, WeatherWear will not provide them as an option for you to choose from. So you might not have any articles of clothing for the current season!
2. If you set your wear cycle to something like 5 days, and you wore it yesterday, WeatherWear will not provide it as an option again until the wear cycle is over.

#Setting an alarm:
1. Go to alarm tab
2. Click + in upper right hand corner to add alarm
3. Select time you want the alarm and the days you want it to repeat
4. Hit save

#Things to note:
The alarm tab page will display all of your saved alarms. You have the option of toggling them on or off if you do/don’t want them to play. When the alarm goes off, WeatherWear will be pulled up, and you can click on NEW to create an outfit for today!

#Creating a vacation:
1. Go to vacation tab
2. Click + in upper right hand corner to add vacation
3. Set name of vacation, zipcode of vacation, and end date of vacation
4. Click on Pack My Bags, this will save your vacation info
5. Click on each day of vacation in the list view (i.e. day one, day two, etc) to decide on the outfit for that day of the vacation
6. Click set outfit to save that outfit for that particular day for that vacation
7. Click done.

#Deleting a vacation:
1. Go to vacation tab
2. Click on the vacation in list view that you want to delete
3. Click on delete button in upper right hand corner

#Things to note:
We do not allow you to change the start date, setting it as today’s date and only allow you to create vacations of up to 5 days. This is because the free version of the weather API we use do not allow for fetching data from the past and only forecasts weather up until 4 days into the future. In order to add more functionality, i.e. longer vacations, altering start dates, WeatherWear would need your investment to purchase these features.

#Editing/viewing a vacation:
1. To view the outfits in a vacation, click on the luggage icon to bring up the different days of your vacation. If you’ve already saved an outfit for that particular day, WeatherWear will bring up that outfit. Otherwise, you’ll be prompted to create an outfit for that day.
2. To edit the name of the vacation, click on the saved vacation in the list view of the vacation tab. We do not allow for you to edit dates or zipcode, because that vacation has generated outfits based on the previous location, and our weather API only fetches weather for today and 4 days into the future. Again, if you’d like to see these features, consider investing in WeatherWear!
3. To edit the outfits in the vacation, you can either click on the luggage icon or on the vacation in list view and then Pack My Bags. Then, when you click on a day that you had previously set an outfit for, you can click NEW in the upper right hand corner to bring up weather appropriate clothing choices for that day.
